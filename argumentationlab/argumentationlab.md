### Part A

#### 1 
> If Goku is a triangle, then given a triangle, it is Goku.
 
> This implies if A then B is the same as if B then A. This is logically
> incorrect because Vegeta could also be a triangle, yet Vegeta != Goku.

#### 2
> Two interviewed serial killers said they were corrupted by porn and that's
> why they killed. Thus, if you watch porn, you will become a serial killer.

> Example of Guilt by assocation and Hasty Generalization fallacies.  This
> implies that all viewers of pornography are or will become serial killers.

#### 3 
> Because you can see the source code of open source software, it's more vulnerable to attack.

> Conclusion can not be drawn from premises provided.

#### 4 
> Reliability testing methods that work for mechanical engineers should work for
> software engineers, because they both build systems out of component parts.
> It's just another kind of engineering!

> Logically valid, because premise (build systems out of component parts) 
> leads to conclusion (both should be able to engineer similarly)

#### 5 
> "Your OS is bad because it's slow, poorly designed, and is missing basic
> features other OSes have." It works for me, so it's good enough for everybody
> else. (analyze the second sentence)

> Implies that everybody else's use of an OS is a subset of the speaker's use.

#### 6
> The Therac-25 incident was shown to be caused by lack of adequate
> testing.  Software engineers should thus be licensed.

> Lack of evidence.  Premises do not lead to conclusion.

#### 7
> The Therac-25 incident was shown to be caused by lack of adequate testing. We
> have proved that inadequate testing can be remedied by requiring engineers in
> such fields to become licensed [Fisher, 2020]. Thus, Software engineers
> should be licensed. (Assume sentence 2 is cited and adequately proven)

> Logically valid argument, because premises of argument correctly lead to conclusion.

#### 8 
> I don't play guitar hero because I play real guitar.

> There is no logical connection between playing Guitar Hero and playing a real guitar. 

#### 9

> There aren't enough girls in the CSC major because girls aren't cut out for
> it. (If you say this is valid, you auto-fail)}


#### 10 
> You should've bought me a slice of pizza! "You said you didn't want one when
> I asked." But you should've known I actually wanted one!

> Logically invalid, because conclusion is in direct violation of one of the premises.

#### 11
> The software engineering code provides a framework within which to make good
> decisions. It is available on the internet. Thus, you should use the SE code of
> ethics.

> Implies that because the SE Code is available, it should be used.  Instructions
> to make bombs are generally available, but should not necessarily be used.

#### 12 
>Java is better than Ruby because Java is object-oriented.}

> Speaker is a fool, because Ruby is object oriented.  Statement is demonstratably false.

#### 13 
> You are beating me in Starcraft, thus clearly you are cheating.}

> Speaker is a 3rd grader.  You should stop playing with him.  Implies that only
> cheaters are capable of beating the speaker.

#### 14 
> Everyone on America's Next Top Model is beautiful because all models are beautiful}

> Implies that every person on America's Next Top Model is a model.  Premise
> doesn't necessarily lead to conclusion.

### Part B

#### 6

> Premise: Mechanical Engineers build systems out of component parts.
> 
> Premise: Software Engineers build systems out of component parts.
> 
> Missing Premise: Mechanical Engineers have proven methods of relability testing.
> 
> Correct Conclusion: Software engineers should be able to use the same reliability testing methods as mechanical engineers.

#### 12

> Premise: Java is object-oriented.
> 
> Missing Incorrect Premise: Ruby is not object oriented.
> 
> Missing Premise: Object oriented languages are better.
> 
> Incorrect Conclusion: Java is better than Ruby.

> For those of you attempting to defend the guy who had the stolen computer by
> saying he had bought it second hand - remember, he couldn't install new
> software or change a lot of settings because they never cracked the admin
> password. Even if he wasn't the guy who stole it of course he knew it was
> stolen, you don't buy a used computer legitimately with old data on it and no
> admin access.
>
> Granted, I wouldn't have shown his face, but my data wasn't stolen and I'm not angry about it.

---

> You don't know whether or not he knew it was stolen. Used computers in
> similar conditions are not uncommon.

---

> You are right that getting used computers with old information on them isn't
> too uncommon. I do still consider it being locked out of admin mode and
> therefore unable to install new software a red flag however.

---
> Again, I don't consider it that uncommon. In fact, a computer of mine ended up with a virus that basically resulted in the same problem.
> 
> Regardless, you'd have to know a few things about computers to know why what
> you consider a red flag would be a red flag. And most people really know very
> little about computers. And the real point is: A red flag isn't a guilty
> verdict. Most people here seem to treat it as if it were.

---

> It doesn't matter if he didn't as long as there are signs that it was stolen
> a person with common sense should consider and double check itï»¿ and old
> data no admin access are more then just signs.
> 
> You can get sentenced for buying stolen stuff if it was foreseeable that it's
> stolen
> 
> At least that's the situation in Germany .. don't know what's the situation
> in Nevada or Massachusetts or where it was stolen again or better where he
> bought it if he didn't steal it .. is :-X
