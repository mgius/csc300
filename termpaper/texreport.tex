\begin{abstract}
Amazon.com is one of the largest sellers of goods and services on the internet.  In 2003, Amazon acquired CreateSpace (formerly CustomFlix) and BookSurge \cite{CustomFlixAcquisition, BookSurgeAcquisition}, which provide ``On-Demand'' publishing services for self-publishing authors. The rise of self publishing services like CreateSpace have lowered the bar for small authors to become published and listed on sites like Amazon. This has allowed more authors to attempt to make a living out of writing.

Recently, a number of books published via CreateSpace and listed on Amazon.com have been removed from Amazon's listings and their Kindle book reader devices.  Public statements from Amazon and personal accounts from authors who have had their books de-listed suggest that books were removed due to their content. 

Is it appropriate for publishers or distributors of books to discriminate what titles they sell due to potentially containing ``offensive content?''  According to the tenets of the ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics, they should not.

Full Disclosure: I am a current employee of CreateSpace, a fully owned subsidiary of Amazon and the publisher of several books that have been de-listed from Amazon's store. To the best of my knowledge, this paper contains no information that is not available to the public.

\section{Facts}

In November 2011 a book entitled ``The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover's Code of Conduct'' was offered for sale through Amazon's Kindle store.  The book reached 150,000 on the Amazon best seller list \cite{TechCrunchAmazonCensorship} before public outcry and attention to the issue raised the book to as high 80 on the Amazon best seller list before it was removed entirely from Amazons' listings \cite{TechCrunchAmazonPedophilia}.

Prior to de-listing ``The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure,'' Amazon released the following statement: ``Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable.  Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts, however, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions.'' \cite{TechCrunchAmazonCensorship}

Amazon has not made any public comments about ``The Pedophile's Guide'' since it has been removed.

In mid December many authors of erotic fiction found themselves de-listed due to violations of ``content policy'' \cite{KittSelfPubRevolution}.  These de-listings were followed by removals of Male/Male erotica and stories with ``rape'' in the title \cite{jamthecat}.  Again, Amazon did not respond publically to requests for explanations regarding the de-listings.  

Amazon currently sells Kindle and physical copies of \underline{Lolita}, a novel that centers around an older man's attempts to seduce a 12-year-old girl \cite{AmazonLolitaDTPListing}.

Amazon and CreateSpace's Member and Content Agreements clearly state that published content can be removed at Amazon's discretion \cite{CreateSpaceMemberAgreement,CreateSpaceContentGuidelines,AmazonKDPContentGuidelines}, and as a private entity Amazon is not bound by the First Amendment's protections of speech. 

All of the books de-listed by Amazon appear to be self-published titles through either Amazon Direct Publishing (Kindle) or CreateSpace (Print on Demand).  Amazon is not the only company offering self-publishing services to authors. Competitors include:
   \begin{description}
   \item[Lulu.com] Provides self-publishing services for books that are very similar to that of Amazon/CreateSpace.  Their content policy also prohibits certain types of content, including obscene or offensive material. \cite{LuluMemberAgreement}

   \item[Barnes and Noble's PubIt!] Self-publishing service allows members to publish eBooks through the Nook bookstore, similar to Amazon's DTP Kindle publishing service.  Their content policy also prohibits certain types of content, including obscene or offensive material.  \cite[Select Service Policies, then Content Policy]{PubItContentPolicy}

   \item[Blurb] Provides self-publishing services, and also has a content policy that forbids certain types of content. \cite{BlurbEULA}
   \end{description}

\subsection{Self Publishing vs. Traditional Publishing}

Because all of the de-listed titles appear to be self-published a short explanation of the major differences between various publishing methods is in order.  I have worked in the Print on Demand publishing industry for over two years, and much of this knowledge is based on my own industry experience.

\subsubsection{Traditional Publishing}

In traditional publishing an author is signed to a publisher and agrees to give a substantial amount of the profits to the publisher.  In exchange, the publisher then offers a number of services to the author.  These services include editing, cover design, art design, and marketing. \cite{WhatPublisherDoes}  At the very end of this process the publisher arranges to have books printed and distributed to retailers. \cite{WhatPublisherDoes}  By the time a book has reached store shelves, the publisher has invested time and money into the author and their work. 

\subsubsection{Traditional Self-Publishing}

When an author chooses to self-publish a book, all of the tasks that would normally be handled by a publishing house, such as copy-editing and marketing, are handled by the author himself.  The author may choose to perform some tasks themselves, such as editing and cover design, while hiring companies or individuals to perform marketing or distribution tasks. The author takes on all of the cost and risk associated with publishing the book, but also keeps all of the profit.

\subsubsection{Print on Demand Self-Publishing}

A somewhat recent development in the self-publishing world is Print on Demand  (POD) publishing.  Prior to POD, traditional and self-publishers were required to print large quantities of books at a time to remain cost-effective. This was especially troublesome for self-publishing authors who were forced to order several thousand dollars worth of books \cite{EHowSelfPub} from printers with no guarantee that the book would ever sell.  Print on Demand uses high quality digital printers to make runs of even a single copy economical. Authors are still responsible for editing and proofing their work, but the initial investment in large print runs can be largely avoided.

\subsubsection{eBook Digital Distribution}

The latest publishing method available to authors is digital distribution.  Although digital copies of books have been available for some time through sites such as Project Gutenberg \cite{ProjectGutenberg} the release of popular book readers (commonly referred to as eReaders) such as Amazon's Kindle and Barnes and Noble's Nook have popularized the format.  When an author publishes their book through a digital distribution channel, such as the Kindle Store, they avoid the cost of printing the book entirely and rely on the owner of the digital distribution channel for distribution.  The author is still responsible for tasks such as editing and cover art.  The ``distributor/printer'' has very little overhead as well.  Rather than needing to store a physical product that takes up space in a warehouse or store shelves, eReaders consume digital files that can be stored very cheaply on hard disks.

When a POD or digital distribution title is removed from circulation the distributor faces very little loss due to minimal investment in a title.  If a traditionally published title were to be de-listed and banned the publisher could lose a significant amount of money due to the investment in the title.

\section{Research Question}
Is the Offensive Material section of Amazon's Self Publishing Content Policy ethical?

\subsection{Why is this important?}

% internet low barrier needs citation
Technologies like Print on Demand and digital distribution lower the barrier to publishing books.  As time goes on more and more authors will publish ever increasing quantities of books.  The lower costs will also make publication of niche topics more cost effective.  These niche topics are likely to offend portions of the population who would rather them not be published.  Much as the internet's low barrier of entry in cost and effort led to an explosion of niche communities and web sites for every conceivable topic, the decreasing barrier to entry and cost of publishing books may lead to an increase in book topic variety.  The rights of authors to publish should be examined early to prevent censoring of material deemed ``offensive.''

\section{Arguments}

\subsection{Amazon's actions are Unethical}

\subsubsection{Selena Kitt}

Selena Kitt, a well known author in the Erotic Literature community with about a dozen published novels, had several of her novels de-listed in December.  She is of the opinion that if Amazon published clear guidelines and enforced them consistently, then the issue would be moot.  She is primarily unhappy with the inconsistency of enforcement and vagueness of Amazon's policies. \cite{KittSelfPubRevolution}

\subsubsection{Erik Sherman}

Erik Sherman, a writer for BNET, believes that Amazon's current public policy is too vague to be helpful to authors.  The policy  ``[allows] individual employees to, intentionally or not, create their own versions of corporate strategy.'' \cite{ShermanAmazonExecs} Sherman thinks that Amazon's policy on Pornography and Offensive Material should be clarified.

\section{Amazon's Actions are Ethical}

\subsection{SJ}

SJ, a blogger, purchased one of the de-listed books, ``The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure,'' so that she could address concerns that all opposed to the book were doing so on false grounds.  She finds the book ``reprehensible,'' and determined that the book in question was a ``how-to-not-get-caught.'' \cite{iasshole}

\section{Analysis}

In the following analysis, there may be some mixing of the company names Amazon and CreateSpace, especially in the context of quoted elements.  CreateSpace is a fully-owned subsidiary of Amazon.  CreateSpace provides self-publishing services for authors and facilitates listing titles on Amazon.com.  In general, I will refer to both entities as Amazon for simplicity, unless reason exists to distinguish them.

\subsection{Content Policy}

Customers of Amazon's self-publishing service must agree with several service agreements before they are allowed to publish content.  Depending on their intended medium, they must agree to either CreateSpace's Content Guidelines \cite{CreateSpaceContentGuidelines} or the Kindle Direct Publishing Content Guidelines \cite{AmazonKDPContentGuidelines}.  Both sets of guidelines contain similar prohibitions against certain types of content.  The CreateSpace Content Guidelines are more specific and expansive that those for KDP, so arguments that follow will focus on CreateSpace's content policy.

CreateSpace's policy prohibits, among other things:

\begin{description}
\item[Offensive Material] \hfill \\
      ``What we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. This includes items such as crime-scene videos, videos of cruelty to animals, and extremely disturbing materials. CreateSpace reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of items sold on our site.'' \cite{CreateSpaceContentGuidelines}

\end{description}

Let's look at the first two sentences in this policy closely.

The first statement, ``What we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect,'' is unclear.  For one, the ``you'' in the sentence is probably intended to refer to the person reading the statement.  However, what one person would expect to be offensive would vary widely from person to person.  In Thai culture, it is considered rude to consume all of the food that is brought to you, because it indicates that the host did not provide enough. \cite{EHowThai}  In Singapore, the possession of chewing gum is a crime, and spitting is also against the law \cite{HotelTravelSingapore}.  As we can see, what is offensive varies by culture, so a policy that expressive offense in terms of a ``you'' will inevitably lead to misunderstandings and confusion.

The next section describes a number of types of content that would be prohibited as ``offensive,'' followed by the catch-all ``extremely disturbing materials.'' Given the context, ``extremely disturbing materials'' could be inferred to mean content similar to those previously listed, but ``disturbing'' is also unclear.  Webster's dictionary defines ``disturbing'' as ``to interfere with.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict}  It is unclear what might be interfered with in this context, but Websters lists ``discomfort'' as a synonym for ``disturbing.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict}  It should be safe to assume that the intention of the policy is to prevent distribution of content that would discomfort consumers.  Unfortunately, what causes discomfort depends heavily on the viewer and the situation.  For example, a video of cows being slaughtered would cause many people to feel uncomfortable.  However, that same video viewed in a classroom environment could be used to educate students in the methods used to prepare animals for consumption.  The same video would be disturbing or extremely helpful based solely upon the context of the viewer. 

Due to preceding impreciseness, it is possible for enforcers of the content policy to inadvertently apply their own sense of ``disturbing'' or ``offensive,'' resulting in inconsistent application of the policy, as Erik Sherman believes \cite{ShermanAmazonExecs}.  This vague or imprecise wording will be examined in further sections to determine whether the section of the content policy is ethical.

\subsection{Is Amazon's Content Policy Incompatible with ACM SE Code}

The ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics is a document produced by the ACM/IEEE-CS joint task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices in 1999. \cite{SECode} It is a document that is meant to guide the ``ethical behavior of and decisions made by \emph{professional software engineers}, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and \emph{policy makers}.'' \cite[Emphasis Mine]{SECode} The ACM SE Code of Ethics is applicable to the issue of whether or not the content guidelines are ethical because Software Engineers working on Amazon's self publishing system are engineering a system that is expected to behave in a congruous manner with the content guidelines. % TODO: Apparently prove this? Seems reasonable enough

It would be foolish to assume that the content policy was written by software engineers at either Amazon or CreateSpace.  However, regardless of who wrote the content policy, Software Engineers are expected to implement software that will enforce or allow enforcement of the content policy.  The persons who wrote the content policy are clearly ``policy makers,'' and thus the content policy and it's creators should abide by the tenets of the ACM SE Code.

\subsubsection{SE Code Tenet 3.08}

\emph{SE Code 3.08}: ensure that \underline{specifications} for \underline{software} on which they work have been well documented [and] satisfy the \underline{users'} requirements\ldots 

In David Parnas and Paul Clements' paper, ``A Rational Design Process,'' Parnas and Clements discuss the nature of software design. \cite{fakeit} In particular, they discuss the nature of requirements specifications and what should be contained within them.  One of the elements of a proper requirements is a specification for Input/Output Interfaces and Specification Of Output Values.  Their description for the Specification of Output Values is of particular interest, and is defined as follows: ``For each output, a specification of its value in terms of the state and history of the system's environment.'' \cite{fakeit} In other words, based on the specifications every input should have an output that is defined. 

Websters defines ``specification'' as ``a written description of an invention for which a patent is sought.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict}  US Title 35, Part II, Chapter 11 \S 112 states the following about the requirements for patents:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.  \cite{Title35}

}

In other words, specifications are the instructions for how to ``build'' a piece of computer software.

Amazon's self-publishing system accepts inputs from users in the form of the content of their books to be published.  The output of this system is a book that is sold on Amazon's site.  The Content Policy defines the set of acceptable inputs to the self-publishing system.  Content that is in violation of the input constraints should be rejected as invalid input.  The Content Policy for the self-publishing system defines the input specification for the self-publishing system. 

The users of the self-publishing system are authors and other content creators who are interested in self-publishing their book through Amazon's self-publishing software.  For the most part, these end-users are completely unaffected by the content guidelines.  A small portion of the overall population of users will nudge up against the content guidelines, and for this subset of users the self-publishing system may not satisfy the users' requirements.

Based on the contents of the Content Guidelines, it can be deduced that these users who are interested in publishing content that may violate their Content Guidelines are not intended to be users of the self-publishing system.  We have to examine a secondary set of users, those who purchase self-published content, for the self-publishing system to see that this deduction is incorrect.  Consider this quote from Russ Grandinetti, the Vice President of Amazon's Kindle Content division:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

``Our vision is [to make] every book ever written, in any language, in print or out of print, all available within 60 seconds'' \cite{LATimesRussQuote}

}

Amazon's mission statement contains a similar description of Amazon's users:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

``Our vision is to be earth's most customer centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover \emph{anything they might want to buy} online.'' \cite[Emphasis Mine]{AmazonIRFAQ}

}

Based on these statements, we can conclude that Amazon's, and their self-publishing system's, ``users'' appear to be the publishers and purchasers of ``every book ever written'' and those looking for ``anything they might want to buy''.

It is important that the self-publishing Content Guidelines be well documented so that users of the self-publishing system can determine whether or not a piece of content is acceptable before they submit it as an input.

We can now rewrite SE Code Tenet 3.08 to apply directly to the situation at hand:

\emph{Substituted SE Code 3.08}: ensure that content guidelines for the self-publishing system on which they work have been well documented and satisfy the requirements of publishers of every book ever written and those looking to buy anything.

The current set of Content Guidelines, especially the guidelines for ``Offensive Content,'' are not well-documented.  As a result, the guideline has been inconsistently enforced.  Amazon removed ``The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure'' for unspecified reasons, but continues to sell ``Lolita'' \cite{AmazonLolitaDTPListing}, the story of an older man attempting to seduce a 12 year old girl. 

Amazon is also clearly not publishing every book ever written, because some books have been recently de-listed.  Amazon is also not providing ``anything'' that their customers might want to buy, as potential consumers of the de-listed media can no longer purchase content that they are interested in.

In it's current state, Amazon's Content Policy is in conflict with SE Code Tenet 3.08 because the Content Policy does not provide a clear specification for user input and does not meet the requirements of its users.  The Content Policy also conflicts with public statements by Amazon executives and their Mission Statement.

\subsubsection{SE Code Tenet 8.03}

\emph{SE Code 8.03}: \ldots produce \underline{accurate}, informative, and well-written \underline{documentation}. 

According to Thesaurus.com, ``accurate'' can also be expressed as ``definitive,'' meaning ``having its fixed and final form; providing a solution or final answer; satisfying all criteria.'' \cite{Thesaurus, Dictionary}  

Let us think of this content policy to be ``documentation'' for the self-publishing platform, where the content policy defines valid and invalid inputs for publishing content on Amazon.  Websters defines documentation as ``the usually printed instructions, comments, and information for using a particular piece or system of computer software or hardware.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict} In other words, documentation will be the set of instructions for the \emph{end-user}, as opposed to specifications, which are instructions for the \emph{software engineer}. 

Websters further defines ``Accurate'' as ``conforming exactly to truth or to a standard.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict} In other words, the documentation should indicate or lead to user instructions that are in line with some consistent standard.  If we rewrite the SE Code to more closely match our system, we are left with the following:

\emph{Substituted SE Code 8.03}: Produce conformant to a standard, informative, and well written content policy.

As it stands, Amazon's policy and the enforcement thereof does not appear to be conformant to any discernable standard.  The policy is not informative because there is great confusion amongst end-users as what exactly falls under the ``offensive material'' content policy.  \cite{KittSelfPubRevolution, ShermanAmazonExecs}  The acceptable content policy is incomplete and ambiguous, which leads to user frustration.  Thus, Amazon's content policy is in conflict with SE Code 8.03.

\subsubsection{SE Code Tenet 8.07}

\emph{SE Code 8.07}: Not give unfair treatment to anyone because of any irrelevant prejudices.

Although the applicability of this tenet should be obvious, it can be rewritten as follows:

\emph{Substituted SE Code 8.07}: [Amazon should] not give unfair treatment to any authors because of any irrelevant prejudices.

It is indisputable that Amazon is treating certain authors differently than others.  As of February 2010, Amazon continues to list Vladimir Nabokov's \emph{Lolita} \cite{AmazonLolitaDTPListing}, a book that centers around an older man's attempt to seduce a 12-year old girl, but has removed \emph{Under Mr. Nolan's Bed}, a story about a father engaging in sexual situations with his underage daughter and her friend, by Selina Kitt. \cite{KittSelfPubRevolution}  

There are two major differences between Ms. Kitt's book and Mr. Nabokov's.  The first is that \emph{Lolita} was published in 1950 \cite{WikipediaLolita} and is considered to be a literary classic \cite{MLTop100}, whereas \emph{Under Mr. Nolan's Bed} was first published in 2010.  Ms. Kitt's book, republished via Barnes and Noble's PubIt! service after being de-listed by Amazon.com, currently holds a four out of five star rating based on over three hundred reviews. \cite{UnderMrNolan} One of Kitt's other stories, \emph{Babysitting the Baumgartners}, is still available on Amazon.com and as of \date{February 24, 2011} is the 20th most popular ``erotica'' novel in both print and digital formats on Amazon.com \cite{AmazonBabysittingListing}.  Ms. Kitt and her works may not be critically rated on the same level as Vladimar Nabokov and \emph{Lolita} but Amazon has not provided any public policy or statement that indicates that critical reception and notoriety are factors in determining whether or not to distribute a title.

The second notable difference between the two works is that \emph{Under Mr. Nolan's Bed} was self-published by Kitt through CreateSpace \cite{KittSelfPubRevolution}, while Lolita is published by Vintage, a traditional New York publishing house.  \cite{WorldCatLolita} It is possible that due to Lolita's status as a traditionally published novel with a large publishing firm standing behind it the novel was afforded more protections than Kitt's novel.  

It is important to note that SE Code 8.07 does not state that software engineers must treat all persons equally.  Rather, the code states that they must ``not give unfair treatment'' due to ``irrelevant prejudices.'' Websters defines unfair as ``not equitable in business dealings.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict}  Amazon appears to be holding authors and their titles to different standards in ``business dealings,'' such that self-published authors and their works find themselves de-listed, where more established authors and publishers do not.  

However, the SE Code only applies if unfair treatment occurs due to ``irrelevant prejudices.''  Websters defines prejudice as ``an irrational attitude of hostility directed against an individual, a group, a race, or their supposed characteristics.'' \cite{WebsterOnlineDict} Affected authors appear to fall under the ``group'' of self-publishing erotic authors, specifically those that deal with taboo situations.  De-listing the content of these authors is certainly a hostile action against the livelihood of the authors because if the authors are not listed, they are not making money.

The question now depends around whether Amazon has given ``unfair treatment'' due to ``irrelevant prejudices.''  Unfortunately, Amazon has not issued any public statements regarding the de-listing.  Because of this, their rationale and purpose behind the de-listings is unknown, forcing speculation.  It is likely that Amazon has refused to comment publicly to avoid setting precedent for their action and draw more criticism in the future.  In this case, it is clearly their intention to create an environment that allows for inconsistent and arbitrary application of the content policy, which is opposite of the behavior specified by the SE Code.

Amazon's policy and their enforcement of it are in conflict with SE Code Tenet 8.07 because it fosters an environment where authors can be, and are, treated differently for no rational reason.

\subsection{Amazon, Censorship and Kant's 2nd Categorical Imperative}

Kay Mathieson, a professor of Philosophy and expert on Information Ethics, defines censorship as follows:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

``To censor is to \emph{restrict or limit access} to an expression, portion of an expression, or category of expression, which has been \emph{made public} by its author, based on the belief that it will be a \emph{bad thing} if people access the content of that expression.'' \cite[Emphasis Mine]{MathiesenCensorship}

}

In her paper, Mathieson also explains her position on the intention of communication, namely that ``the goal of freedom of expression is not that a speaker gets to speak, but that people are able to communicate with each other.''   \cite{MathiesenCensorship} In other words, even if a person is not preventing a speaker from speaking, they may be preventing a listener from listening.  By interfering with free communication between two willing parties an agent has engaged in censorship. 

Amazon's content policy does not stop authors from writing what they please and attempting to sell it.  However, by de-listing their content Amazon is creating a barrier between the writer and their willing readers.  This wall is particularly galling because Amazon allowed the book to be distributed for a time, then removed it without explanation.  Amazon's actions restrict access to these expressions after initially allowing them.

The very act of publishing by an author in effect makes the work public.  The question then falls on whether or not Amazon considers this speech to be a ``bad thing.''  Prior to de-listing ``The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure'' Amazon issued the following statement:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

``Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable.  Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts, however, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions.'' \cite{TechCrunchAmazonCensorship}

}

Based on that statement, Amazon appears to believe that delivering content to consumers is more important than restricting access to potentially objectionable content. However, Amazon later de-listed the book without public explanation.  Because of the lack of public explanation, it is impossible to determine the exact reason that Amazon removed the book from distribution.  However, Mathieson discusses in her paper censorship of content due to ``[moral disapproval] of what persons might \emph{do} with [the] information.'' \cite{MathiesenCensorship} Amazon may be concerned that distribution of this title, and others with similar messages, may have a negative impact on society.

These actions appear to be in violation of Deontological principles.  In particular, they run contrary to Kant's second categorical imperative:

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{6mm}

``Act so that you treat humanity, both in your own person and in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means.'' \cite{KantCategorical}

}

In more plain english, one should never use a person to further their own goals, especially at the expense of the other person. 

At first, Amazon's relationship with authors is mutually beneficial.  The author provides a product for Amazon to sell and Amazon facilitates distribution of the author's work.  Because neither is working against each other and both benefit the two parties are both ``ends.''  The author helps Amazon fulfill it's goal of generating revenue and profit and Amazon helps the author to generate income and distribute his ideas in the marketplace.  Each's actions treat each other as an end.

When Amazon censors books, and especially when they de-list them after offering them for sale publically, it becomes apparent that Amazon's interest in self-publishing authors is as a means to an end rather than an end in itself.  Specifically, self-publishing authors are a means to earning more money and improving Amazon's selection.  Any benefit to the author appears to be irrelevant to Amazon's decisions.  If Amazon felt that an author was an end in itself they would not remove an authors book from circulation, or at the very least decline to list it initially.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Conclusion %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
Amazon's Content Policy for self-published works are unethical because they do not conform to the ACM SE Code of Ethics requirements for documentation, specification and equal treatment, and promotes censorship of works in violation of deontological princicples.  To bring their system in line with the SE Code of Ethics, Amazon should clarify their Content Policies such that authors can know prior to submission whether their content meets the guidelines.  To solve the censorship issue, Amazon should allow self-publishers to sell any content that is not strictly illegal.
