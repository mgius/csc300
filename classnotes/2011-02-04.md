# Defect Classification
1. Defect in "Manufacture"
   * if product "departs from intended design"
      - internal, technical standard: descriptive (correctness)
         * risky "mistakes" are not socially beneficial
         * __strict standard - "due care" irrelevant__
            * If you do not build something according to specs, you are
              responsible.  Even if your spec would have made it safe
2. Defect in "Design"
   * if design saftey is not (socially) defensible
      - external, social standard: normative
         * risky "intention" may bring social benefit
         * __negligence standard - "due care" is central__
            * "Oh, we didn't test that" is not an excuse
            * If you don't take appropriate steps for protecting your customer,
              doesn't work
   * Did you write a stupid spec
   * Imposed by juries and society.  Jury says "you were negligent."  But
     experts could argue that newer methods weren't available at the time.

# Descriptive vs Normative
Comes back to trans-science issues

* Descriptive
   * Science
   * What "is" 
   * existence

* Normative
   * What "should be" desirable

Humans can move towards more ideal (normative) world, even if it isn't the way
it "is" right now.

Requirements document would be normative, because it is how it should work. But
after the implementation happens, the document is descriptive, because it's how
it now works.
